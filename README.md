- `DeepLX` is using `DeepL` Free API.
- `DeepLX` is unlimited to the number of requests.

## Usage
### Request Parameters
- text: string
- source_lang: string
- target_lang: string

### Response
```json
{
  "alternatives": [
    "no one else",
    "there is no other person (idiom); there is no one else",
    "there is no other person"
  ],
  "code": 200,
  "data": "there is no one else",

### Specify the port (Optional)
**Thanks to [cijiugechu](https://github.com/cijiugechu) for [his contribution](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX/commit/4a0920579ea868b0f05ccdff6bceae316bfd5dc8) to make this feature possible for this project!**
```bash
./deeplx -p 3333
# or
./deeplx -port 3333
```
### Set access password (Optional)
**To prevent abuse of your public API, you can use a token to restrict translation requests.**
```bash
./deeplx -token hellodeeplx
```

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:1188/translate \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token" \
-d '{
    "text": "Hello, world!",
    "source_lang": "EN",
    "target_lang": "DE"
}'

```

## Setup on [Bob App](https://bobtranslate.com/)
1. Install [bob-plugin-deeplx](https://github.com/missuo/bob-plugin-deeplx) on Bob.

2. Setup the API. (If you use Brew to install locally you can skip this step)
![c5c19dd89df6fae1a256d](https://missuo.ru/file/c5c19dd89df6fae1a256d.png)

## Setup on [immersive-translate](https://github.com/immersive-translate/immersive-translate)
**It is not recommended, because the `immersive-translate` will send many requests in a short time, which will cause the `DeepL API` to block your IP.**

1. Install Latest [immersive-translate ](https://github.com/immersive-translate/immersive-translate/releases) on your browser.

2. Click on **Developer Settings** in the bottom left corner. **Enable Beta experimental features**.

3. Set the URL. (If you are not deploying locally, you need to change 127.0.0.1 to the IP of your server)

![6a48ba28621f2465028f0](https://missuo.ru/file/6a48ba28621f2465028f0.png)

## Use in Python
```python
import httpx, json

deeplx_api = "http://127.0.0.1:1188/translate"

data = {
	"text": "Hello World",
	"source_lang": "EN",
	"target_lang": "ZH"
}

post_data = json.dumps(data)
r = httpx.post(url = deeplx_api, data = post_data).text
print(r)
```
