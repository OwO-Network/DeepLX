brew tap owo-network/brew
brew install deeplx
brew services start owo-network/brew/deeplx

# Update to the latest version
brew update
brew upgrade deeplx
brew services restart owo-network/brew/deeplx

# View the currently installed version
brew list --versions deeplx
```

sudo mv deeplx_darwin_amd64 /usr/local/bin/deeplx
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/deeplx

## Setup on [Bob App](https://bobtranslate.com/)
1. Install [bob-plugin-deeplx](https://github.com/missuo/bob-plugin-deeplx) on Bob.

2. Setup the API. (If you use Brew to install locally you can skip this step)

## Setup on [immersive-translate](https://github.com/immersive-translate/immersive-translate)
**It is not recommended, because the `immersive-translate` will send many requests in a short time, which will cause the `DeepL API` to block your IP.**

1. Install Latest [immersive-translate ](https://github.com/immersive-translate/immersive-translate/releases) on your browser.

2. Click on **Developer Settings** in the bottom left corner. **Enable Beta experimental features**.

3. Set the URL. (If you are not deploying locally, you need to change 127.0.0.1 to the IP of your server)

## Use in Python

import httpx, json

deeplx_api = "http://127.0.0.1:1188/translate"

data = {
	"text": "Hello World",
	"source_lang": "EN",
	"target_lang": "ZH"
}

post_data = json.dumps(data)
r = httpx.post(url = deeplx_api, data = post_data).text
print(r)
```
